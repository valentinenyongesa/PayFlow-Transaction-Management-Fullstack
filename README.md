This is a Transactin Management System named PayFlow that seeks to handle various operations related to the creation, modification, tracking, and reporting of transactions, typically for a business, an organization, or an individual. 

Steps involved in creating the app include:
Create a Virtual Environment: python3 -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:source venv/bin/activate

Install Django:pip install django

Create the Django Project:django-admin startproject payflow .
to create a new Django project called payflow inside your current folder

Run the Django Development Server:python manage.py runserver

Apply Migrations:python manage.py migrate

Run the startapp Command to create a new app. For example, let's create an app called transactions that will handle your transaction logic:python manage.py startapp transactions

Register the App in the Project Settings

Create Models in the transactions App

Make Migrations and Migrate

First, create the migration files for the transactions app:python manage.py makemigrations transactions

Applied Migrations: Running python manage.py migrate transactions applied the migration, creating the necessary table in your SQLite database.This will generate the necessary database tables for the Transaction model.


Make the transactions/views.py: Defines the logic for handling requests and returning responses for specific actions related to the transactions, such as displaying transaction lists or details.

Make the transactions/urls.py: Maps specific URL paths to corresponding views in the transactions app, enabling routing of HTTP requests within the app.

Make the payflow/urls.py: Acts as the main URL configuration for the project, linking to different app-specific urls.py files, including transactions, to manage overall routing.

Add transaction status field to Transaction model to show whether transaction is pending, completed or has failed

Add the serializers.py file that converts Transaction objects into JSON so that they can be sent to the frontend via API responses and also allows new transactions to be created from JSON data received in API requests.

Create the transactions/views.py file that handles the logic for processing requests and returning responses related to the Transaction model. It defines the views that manage operations like listing transactions, creating new ones, updating, or deleting them. These views interact with the models and serializers to process data and send appropriate responses back to the user or API client.

Add URL pattern for creating new transactions in transactions app in the transactions/url.py file. This maps the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/transactions/create/ to the create_transaction

Install React: You need to set up a new React app to communicate with your Django backend. In your project directory : npx create-react-app payflow-frontend

Install Axios: Axios will be used to make HTTP requests to your Django API. : npm install axios

Fetch Transactions in React: Open src/App.js and modify it to fetch transaction data from Django.: describes the key action of fetching transactions from the Django backend and displaying them in the React frontend.

Modify your App.js to add a form for submitting new transactions:

Backend (API Routes)
From your App.js, I can infer two main backend routes for my API.

GET Route (Fetching Transactions)
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/transactions/
This route is used to fetch all transactions from the backend.
When the component mounts, useEffect fetches this data.
POST Route (Creating a New Transaction)
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/transactions/create/
This route is used to create a new transaction when the form is submitted.
The form data (description and amount) is sent in the request body, and upon success, the new transaction is added to the list.
